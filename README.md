# Sales Data Analysis Tutorial by Kaith Galli  

The purpose of this project was to replicate real world data science tasks.

This analysis looks into tech product sales across the US. 

First the data is prepared for analysis by filling in and deleting missing values,
as well as adding columns for analysis. 

This analysis answers questions like:
  1) Which month is the best for sales?
  2) How much is earned in the top month of sales?
  3) Which city sold the most products?
  4) In what city should the company focus its advertising revenue?
  5) What products are compliments of one another based on being sold together?
  6) Which product generates the most sales? Why?
